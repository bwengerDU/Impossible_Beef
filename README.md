# Impossible_Beef

## Project Overview

In this project I am helping a friend, Roza, run an analysis on varying types of bellly button bacteria that may be suitable for producing synthetic beef. The focus of this project is to utilize Plotly in order to develop detailed and insightful data visualizations for Roza to use in her analysis of bacteria. I also need to create a program that will allow her to manipulate the data. I utilized the map() method to allow transformation for each element, filter() functions will be used to extract desired information, sorth () method will be used to arrange data, and the slice () method to select subsets from within the full data. A bar chart, bubble chart, and gauge chart are created to provide visualizations for key bacteria data needed to assess the various test subjects. 

## Page customizations 

I added three elements into my page in order to enhance the aesthetics of the site. Firstly, I added an image to the Jumbotron. This created a few visual issues with my text in that area so I had to change the text color and also make it bold so that it could be legible. I added a paragraph to give further explanation as to what the page and the project is designed for. Within this paragraph I added a few sections of highlighted text to tie together the two main elements of the project description. I also set the background for the entire webpage to be a light blue and this made the various sections on the site stand out more.
