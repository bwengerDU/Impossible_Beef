# Impossible_Beef

## Project Overview
In this project I am helping a friend, Roza, run an analysis on varying types of bellly button bacteria that may be suitable for producing synthetic beef. The focus of this project is to utilize Plotly in order to develop detailed and insightful data visualizations for Roza to use in her analysis of bacteria. I also need to create a program that will allow her to manipulate the data. I utilized the map() method to allow transformation for each element, filter() functions will be used to extract desired information, sorth () method will be used to arrange data, and the slice () method to select subsets from within the full data.
